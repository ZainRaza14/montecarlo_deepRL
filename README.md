# montecarlo_deepRL

In this project I have implemented the monte carlo methods used in reinfocement learning.

I have used Blackjack environment from Open AI's gym toolkit. 

Following concepts have been implemented:

First Visit MC Prediction for state values, First Visit MC Prediction for action values, First Visit GLIE(Greedy in limit with Infinite Exploration) MC Control and First Visit Constant alpha GLIE MC Control.
